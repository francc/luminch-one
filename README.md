Luminch One
===========

Luminch One is an interactive lamp controlled by the movements of your hand.
Wave your hand over it to turn it on or off, or move your hand up or down
above it to change its brightness. Inside the lamp, an Arduino hooked to an
infrared distance sensor tracks your hand and sets the state and the
brightness of the LED lamp.
